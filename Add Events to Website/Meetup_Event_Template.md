## Introduction :shipit:

R-Ladies Chicago Meetups currently fall under two categories.
1. Main Meetup meetings
2. Study groups

## Main Meetup meetings
These are the core meetings of the group. They cover a variety topics and are planned months in advance. These can either be **technical** or **social** meetups.  
Main meetup meetings are held once a month and food is usually provided.


## Study groups
Study groups meet separately from our monthly meetups to talk about specific topics in R. Each study group is organized by an R-Ladies member. Study groups can meet viturally or in person and frequency varies based on the organizer. Please note R-Ladies Chicago cannot financially contribute to study group meetings but will advertise and provide other non-financial resources (connections to experts and meeting places) to the group.  

## Template

### Name of the meetup or study group

If it is a main meetup meeting the title should be descriptive of the topic of the meetup and include the speaker's name if possible/applicable.  
*Prior event titles have included:* 
- Make your own R package from scratch with Stephanie Kirmer  
- Intro to R Markdown + Collaborative Coding Activity w/ Kaylene McClanahan  
- R-Ladies Summer Social: Sip & Code!  
  
  
If it is a study group meeting, the title should start with the study group name then a descriptive topic-related name
**Study Group Name: Descriptive Title**   
  
 *For example:*  
 - NLP Study Group: tf-idf  
 - Dataviz Study Group: Intro to ggplot2  

### Details
Include a brief description of the meetup. 

This should start with a clear description of whether this is a main meetup or study group. Meetup descriptions should start with the following sentence:   

> For our [MONTH] meetup, [SPEAKER NAME] will be talking about [TOPIC(s)].   

The details section should also include:  
  
- What level of users will benefit from this meetup. i.e. everyone, beginners, intermediate ..etc  
- If there is a collaborative coding activity and what participants need to prepare for this  
- A brief bio of the speaker(s)  
- Be sure to look at our [Meetup Page](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-chicago/) to see descriptions from prior events.  
  
**If this event is not a main technical meetup,** the last part of the description should be one of the following texts based on the type of event:  
  
#### Social/Community Meetups  
There will be no formal technical talk at this meeting; rather, a time to network with fellow R-Ladies while doing a collaborative coding activity. This is part of our “social” Meetups, focused on networking and idea exchange.  
  
#### Study Group Meetings  
Study groups meet separately from our monthly meetups to talk about specific topics in R. Typically, this is a more collaborative meeting instead of a formal presentation where everyone contributes to the discussion. *[if there is a limit on the number if attendees, mention that here]*
